# Part A Implementation - Note Collection System

## ‚úÖ What I Built (Part A Only)

Following your workflow, I implemented **just the foundation** - collecting notes from owner and workers.

### Components Created:
1. **`NoteInput.tsx`** - Simple note input for owner/worker
2. **`NotesViewer.tsx`** - Shows recent notes collected
3. **`simple-notes-table.sql`** - Basic notes storage

### Your Workflow - Part A:
```
Owner: "Bought magnolia whole chicken 20 bags, each bag 10 chickens"
‚Üì
Saved to notes table
‚Üì
AI will learn from this pattern (Part B - later)
```

### What You Can Do Now:
1. **Go to Stock Management page**
2. **Type notes** like:
   - "Bought magnolia whole chicken 20 bags with 10 chickens each"
   - "Chopped chicken: got 35 bags with 40 pieces each"
   - "Sent to branch1: 3 bags + 1 neck bag"
   - "Branch1 cooked 1 bag, sold 20 pieces at 35 pesos"

3. **See notes collected** in the viewer

### Database:
```sql
notes table:
- id (uuid)
- content (text) - the actual note
- user_role (owner/worker)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

## üéØ This is JUST Part A

- ‚úÖ **Collect notes** from owner/workers
- ‚ùå AI parsing (Part B)
- ‚ùå Stock updates (Part C) 
- ‚ùå Pattern learning (Part D)

**Next:** Once you have notes collected, we move to Part B - AI parsing with Gemini API.

This is **simple and working** - no complexity, just note collection to start the workflow.
