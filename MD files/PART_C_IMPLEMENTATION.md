# Part C Implementation - Stock Updates

## âœ… What I Added (Part C)

Following your workflow, I implemented **stock updates** that apply parsed AI data to actual products and sales.

### ðŸ”§ **Changes Made:**

1. **`services/stockService.ts`** - Applies parsed data to stock/sales/expenses
2. **`components/NoteInput.tsx`** - Added "ðŸ“Š Apply to Stock" button
3. **`components/NotesViewer.tsx`** - Shows "âœ… Applied" status

### ðŸŽ¯ **Your Complete Workflow - Parts A+B+C:**

```
1. Owner types: "Bought magnolia whole chicken 20 bags with 10 chickens each. Sent 3 bags to branch1. Branch1 cooked 1 bag and sold 20 pieces at 35 pesos."

2. Clicks "ðŸ¤– Parse" â†’ AI extracts structured data

3. Clicks "Save" â†’ Saves note with parsed data

4. Clicks "ðŸ“Š Apply to Stock" â†’ Updates actual stock and creates sales records
```

### ðŸš€ **What Happens When You Apply to Stock:**

**Purchases:** 
- Finds/creates "magnolia whole chicken" product
- Adds 200 pieces to stock (20 bags Ã— 10 chickens)
- Creates expense record

**Sales:**
- Creates sale record for 20 pieces at 35 pesos
- Reduces stock by 20 pieces
- Records revenue

**Cooking:**
- Reduces stock by cooked amounts

**Status:**
- Note marked as "âœ… Applied"

### ðŸ“Š **Database Updates:**
```sql
products table: stock updated
sales table: new sale records created  
expenses table: purchase costs recorded
notes table: status = 'applied'
```

### ðŸŽ¯ **Test Complete Workflow:**

1. **Go to Stock Management page**
2. **Type:** "Bought magnolia whole chicken 20 bags with 10 chickens each. Branch1 cooked 1 bag and sold 20 pieces at 35 pesos."
3. **Click "ðŸ¤– Parse"** â†’ See AI extracted data
4. **Click "Save"** â†’ Note saved with parsed data
5. **Click "ðŸ“Š Apply to Stock"** â†’ Stock updated, sales created!
6. **Check Products page** â†’ See updated stock
7. **Check Transactions page** â†’ See new sales

**Parts A+B+C Complete!** Your notes now control actual stock and sales data. AI learns from your patterns and updates the real business data.
