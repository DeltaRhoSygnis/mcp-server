// ============================================================================
// MEMORY SERVER CAPABILITIES ANALYSIS
// ============================================================================

/*
The Memory MCP Server provides:

1. ENTITIES - People, places, things in your business
   - Suppliers (Magnolia, San Miguel, etc.)
   - Customers (regular buyers, restaurants)
   - Workers (branch staff, processing team)
   - Products (whole chickens, parts, necks)
   - Branches (locations, stores)

2. RELATIONS - How entities connect
   - "Magnolia" supplies_to "Main_Branch"
   - "Customer_Restaurant_A" prefers "chicken_parts"
   - "Worker_Maria" works_at "Branch_2"
   - "Branch_1" processes "whole_chickens"

3. OBSERVATIONS - Facts about entities
   - "Magnolia delivers on Tuesdays and Fridays"
   - "Customer_Restaurant_A orders 50kg weekly"
   - "Worker_Juan is expert at chicken processing"
   - "Branch_2 sells more necks than parts"

// ENHANCED AI CAPABILITIES WITH MEMORY
// ============================================================================

const ENHANCED_CAPABILITIES = {
  
  // 1. INTELLIGENT NOTE PARSING
  noteParsingWithMemory: `
    When parsing: "Buy magnolia chicken 20 bags"
    
    WITHOUT MEMORY: Basic parsing
    - Supplier: magnolia
    - Product: chicken
    - Quantity: 20 bags
    
    WITH MEMORY: Intelligent context
    - Supplier: Magnolia_Supplier (known entity)
    - Expected cost: 20 * 1200 = 24,000 pesos
    - Delivery day: Tuesday or Friday
    - Processing capacity: Worker_Maria can handle this
    - Customer impact: Enough for Restaurant_Lucky_Dragon + 10 bags extra
  `,

  // 2. PROACTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS
  recommendations: `
    AI can now suggest:
    - "Magnolia usually delivers on Fridays, schedule Worker_Maria"
    - "Restaurant_Lucky_Dragon will need parts soon, start processing"
    - "Christmas season approaching, increase orders by 200%"
    - "New supplier has better prices, but check delivery reliability"
  `,

  // 3. PATTERN RECOGNITION
  patterns: `
    Memory enables:
    - "This customer always orders before weekends"
    - "Summer months have 30% less neck sales"
    - "Worker_Juan is most efficient with morning deliveries"
    - "Branch_2 needs restocking every 3 days"
  `
