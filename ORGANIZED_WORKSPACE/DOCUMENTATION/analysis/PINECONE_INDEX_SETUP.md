# üìå Pinecone Index Setup Guide - Detailed Steps

## üéØ Overview
You'll create a Pinecone index to store vector embeddings for your AI memory system. This index will handle semantic search and AI memory retrieval.

## üìã Step-by-Step Pinecone Index Creation

### Step 1: Access Pinecone Console

1. **Login to Pinecone**
   - Go to [app.pinecone.io](https://app.pinecone.io)
   - Sign in with your existing account
   - You should see your dashboard

### Step 2: Create New Index

1. **Click "Create Index" button**
   - Located in the top-right or center of dashboard
   - Green button that says "+ Create Index"

2. **Configure Index Settings**

   **üìù Index Configuration:**
   ```
   Index Name: chicken-business-memory
   Dimensions: 1536
   Metric: cosine
   Pod Type: Starter (Free)
   Environment: us-east1-gcp
   Replicas: 1
   Shards: 1
   ```

   **üîß Detailed Settings Explanation:**

   - **Index Name**: `chicken-business-memory`
     - ‚úÖ Use exactly this name (matches your code)
     - ‚ùå Don't use spaces or special characters
     - ‚ùå Don't use uppercase letters

   - **Dimensions**: `1536`
     - ‚úÖ Standard for OpenAI/Gemini embeddings
     - ‚úÖ Compatible with most AI models
     - ‚ùå Don't change this unless you know your model's dimensions

   - **Metric**: `cosine`
     - ‚úÖ Best for text similarity
     - ‚úÖ Works well with normalized vectors
     - Alternatives: euclidean, dotproduct

   - **Pod Type**: `Starter`
     - ‚úÖ Free tier option
     - ‚úÖ 1 pod, 100,000 vectors max
     - ‚úÖ Perfect for your chicken business use case

### Step 3: Advanced Configuration

1. **Environment Settings**
   ```
   Cloud: GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
   Region: us-east1 (Iowa)
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Free tier is available in us-east1-gcp
   - ‚úÖ Good latency for most locations

2. **Performance Settings**
   ```
   Replicas: 1 (minimum for free tier)
   Shards: 1 (minimum for free tier)
   ```

### Step 4: Create the Index

1. **Review Configuration**
   ```
   Index Name: chicken-business-memory
   Dimensions: 1536
   Metric: cosine
   Environment: us-east1-gcp
   Pod Type: Starter
   Estimated Cost: $0.00/month (Free tier)
   ```

2. **Click "Create Index"**
   - Index creation takes 2-5 minutes
   - Status will show "Initializing" then "Ready"

### Step 5: Get Connection Details

1. **After index is ready, click on index name**
2. **Copy these details for your .env:**
   ```
   Environment: us-east1-gcp
   Index Name: chicken-business-memory
   Endpoint: https://chicken-business-memory-xxxxx.svc.us-east1-gcp.pinecone.io
   ```

---

## üîë Update Your .env File

Add these exact values to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Pinecone Configuration (update these)
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_existing_api_key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=us-east1-gcp
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=chicken-business-memory
PINECONE_INDEX_HOST=chicken-business-memory-xxxxx.svc.us-east1-gcp.pinecone.io
```

---

## üß™ Test Your Pinecone Index

### Option 1: Using Pinecone Console
1. Go to your index dashboard
2. Click "Query" tab
3. Try a test query with random vector

### Option 2: Using curl (recommended)
```bash
# Test index exists
curl -X GET \
  "https://controller.us-east1-gcp.pinecone.io/databases/chicken-business-memory" \
  -H "Api-Key: YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"

# Expected response: Index details in JSON
```

### Option 3: Using Node.js test
```javascript
// test-pinecone.js
const { PineconeClient } = require('@pinecone-database/pinecone');

async function testPinecone() {
  const client = new PineconeClient();
  await client.init({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY',
    environment: 'us-east1-gcp'
  });
  
  const index = client.Index('chicken-business-memory');
  const stats = await index.describeIndexStats();
  console.log('‚úÖ Pinecone connected:', stats);
}

testPinecone();
```

## üìä What Will Be Stored in Pinecone

Your Pinecone index will store:

### **Vector Embeddings For:**
1. **AI Memory Entities**
   ```
   - Customer conversations
   - Business insights
   - Operational patterns
   - Decision histories
   ```

2. **Business Knowledge**
   ```
   - Product information
   - Pricing strategies
   - Market insights
   - Competitor analysis
   ```

3. **Contextual Memory**
   ```
   - Recent interactions
   - User preferences
   - Conversation context
   - Behavioral patterns
   ```

### **Vector Metadata Structure**
```json
{
  "id": "memory_12345",
  "values": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...], // 1536 dimensions
  "metadata": {
    "type": "conversation",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-27T10:00:00Z",
    "entity_id": "customer_001",
    "content": "Customer asked about chicken prices",
    "importance": "high",
    "business_context": "sales_inquiry"
  }
}
```

## üìà Free Tier Limits

| Limit | Free Tier | Your Usage |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **Vectors** | 100,000 | Perfect for business |
| **Dimensions** | Up to 2000 | Using 1536 ‚úÖ |
| **Queries/month** | 5M | More than enough |
| **Storage** | Included | Vector data only |
| **Pods** | 1 starter pod | Sufficient |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Index name already exists"**
   - Choose different name like `chicken-business-memory-v2`
   - Or delete existing index if it's a test

2. **"Environment not available"**
   - Use `us-east1-gcp` (only free environment)
   - Don't use `us-west1-gcp` or others

3. **"Dimensions mismatch"**
   - Always use 1536 for OpenAI/Gemini embeddings
   - Check your embedding model requirements

4. **"API key invalid"**
   - Verify API key in Pinecone console
   - Make sure key has proper permissions

### Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check index exists
curl -H "Api-Key: $PINECONE_API_KEY" \
  https://controller.us-east1-gcp.pinecone.io/databases/chicken-business-memory

# List all indexes
curl -H "Api-Key: $PINECONE_API_KEY" \
  https://controller.us-east1-gcp.pinecone.io/databases

# Get index stats
curl -X POST \
  "https://chicken-business-memory-xxxxx.svc.us-east1-gcp.pinecone.io/describe_index_stats" \
  -H "Api-Key: $PINECONE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
