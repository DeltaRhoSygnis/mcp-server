**OPENRoute MODELS RATE LIMITS**
ðŸš€ OpenRouter Free Tier (No Credits Purchased)

You can use free-variant models (those with :free in the name, e.g. x-ai/grok-4-fast:free or deepseek/deepseek-r1:free).

Limits if you have 0 credits purchased:

50 requests per day total across free models.

20 requests per minute max.

1000 request per month total across free models.

Thatâ€™s it â€” you wonâ€™t be able to exceed those until you add â‰¥ 10 credits (which unlocks up to 1,000 free-model requests/day).

So yes, there is a free tier, but itâ€™s tiny unless you add at least a small payment.
